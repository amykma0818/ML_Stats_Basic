### 1. What is standard error of mean, how to compute it, and how to interpret it?
* Standard error is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean, `s = Ïƒ/sqrt(n)`. It refers to the standard deviation of the distribution of sample means
taken from a population. The smaller the standard error, the more representative the sample will be of the overall population (a measurement for the
spread, the smaller the spread, the more accurate the dataset).
